# elliptic-curve

This is a simple implementation of elliptic curve crypto operations. It's inspired by this [great article](https://curves.ulfheim.net/). 

### Curve61
The operations are executed on the toy Curve61 $y^2 = x^3 + 9*x + 1$ so I can play with it with pen and paper on the side.

### Run
The example is written in python3. You can run it with:
```
python3 test.py
python3 elliptic.py
```
